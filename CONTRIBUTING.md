## Layout

- `cmd/herdr-world` — server-side bridge daemon (Go).
- `cmd/h3d-helper` — Mac-side helper (Go, cross-compiled for `darwin/arm64`).
- `internal/` — shared Go packages. Bridge: `herdr` (the only door to herdr: the read-only client and the allowlisted
  control surface for wake/sleep), `watch` (session discovery and per-session watchers), `world` (floors/workers from
  snapshots and `session.json`, identity matching, worker names), `store` (SQLite), `server` (hub + WebSocket, wake/sleep,
  floor settings), `proto` (protocol v1 types and client), `gitremote` (GitHub origin of a directory, for the repo
  suggestion), `codex` (Codex session ids from rollout files, for the sleep backfill). Helper: `helper` (ssh tunnel
  supervisor, game server, `/ws` proxy). `app` holds both command lines.
- `deploy/` — `herdr-world.service` (systemd `--user`), `com.jeffreyvdb.h3d-helper.plist` (launchd user agent, Mac).
- `game/` — the game: Vite + strict TypeScript + three.js (`three/webgpu`), pnpm.

## Toolchain

Go 1.27 (see `go.mod`), Node 24.18 (`game/.nvmrc`), pnpm 11.7 (`packageManager` in `game/package.json`),
`portlease` for ports. CI uses the same pins.

## Build and test

```sh
make build test lint   # Go binaries -> bin/, game bundle -> game/dist/, go test + vitest, vet/gofmt/tsc
make integration       # bridge against a real herdr (and systemd-run) in throwaway sessions (see below)
make helper-darwin     # bin/darwin-arm64/h3d-helper (CGO off)
make dev               # Vite dev server on a portlease-leased port, 127.0.0.1 only
make shot              # headless WebGL2 screenshot -> game/test-results/shot.png (non-blank check)
```

- `make shot` runs Playwright against the **cached** Chromium in `~/.cache/ms-playwright` (`@playwright/test` is pinned
  to the version that matches it). Browsers are never downloaded (`PLAYWRIGHT_SKIP_BROWSER_DOWNLOAD=1`). It forces the
  WebGL2 backend (`?backend=webgl2`) because the server has no GPU; rendering goes through ANGLE → Vulkan → mesa llvmpipe.
- The page exposes `window.__h3d` (`backend`, `frames`, `error`) for tests.
- Never hardcode ports. Use `portlease run` / `portlease reserve`, and bind `127.0.0.1` only. Other agents run in
  parallel worktrees on the same host.
- CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs go vet/gofmt/test, the darwin cross-build, tsc and vitest. No Playwright in CI.
- `go test ./internal/helper` never runs ssh: the test binary stands in for it (`H3D_FAKE_SSH`) and forwards to an
  in-process bridge.

## Bridge (`herdr-world`)

Protocol: [`docs/protocol.md`](docs/protocol.md). Every herdr call goes through `internal/herdr`, in two allowlisted
parts:

- **Reads** (`herdr.Client`): the socket methods `ping`, `session.snapshot` and `events.subscribe`, plus `herdr session
  list --json`. `TestReadOnlyAllowlist` is the tripwire.
- **Writes, for `floor.wake` / `floor.sleep` only** (`herdr.Control`): exactly six command shapes (`controlShapes`):
  `systemd-run --user --unit=herdr-s-<name> … /bin/fish -l -c "exec herdr --session '<name>' server"`, `herdr session
  stop <name> --json`, `herdr --session <name> pane run <pane> "claude --resume <id>"` / `"codex resume <id>"`, `herdr
  --session <name> pane report-agent-session <pane> --source herdr:codex --agent codex --agent-session-id <id>`, and
  the read-only `herdr --session <name> pane process-info --pane <pane>`. Session names, pane ids and agent session ids
  are validated, every argument is its own argv element, sessions outside `--sessions` are refused, and commands run
  with the `HERDR_*`/`CLAUDE*` variables stripped. `TestControlAllowlist` pins the set and the argv; widening either
  needs review.

Everything else the bridge changes is its own SQLite database. How a wake and a sleep go, and what they log:
[`docs/protocol.md` "Wake and sleep"](docs/protocol.md#wake-and-sleep).

Run a private instance next to (or instead of) the real one; `dump` and `cmd` take the same `--socket`:

```sh
make go-build
sock=$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/h3d-dev/bridge.sock   # unix socket paths must stay under ~107 bytes
bin/herdr-world --socket "$sock" --db /tmp/h3d-dev/world.db --log-level debug
bin/herdr-world dump --socket "$sock"            # snapshot, then events as JSON lines until Ctrl-C
bin/herdr-world dump --socket "$sock" --once | jq '.world.floors'
bin/herdr-world cmd --socket "$sock" building.create '{"name":"Work"}'
bin/herdr-world cmd --socket "$sock" floor.assign '{"session":"herdr-3d","building":"b_…"}'
bin/herdr-world cmd --socket "$sock" floor.settings.set '{"session":"herdr-3d","repo":"JeffreyVdb/herdr-3d"}'
```

A private bridge acts on real sessions as soon as it is sent `floor.sleep` or `floor.wake`. Always start it with a
`--sessions` that matches only your throwaway sessions (e.g. `'^h3d-mytask-'`), so it cannot even see the sessions
everyone works in. To try wake and sleep safely:

```sh
s=h3d-mytask-$(od -An -N3 -tx1 /dev/urandom | tr -d ' \n')
systemd-run --user --unit=herdr-s-$s --collect -p KillMode=process --working-directory=$HOME \
  /bin/fish -l -c "exec herdr --session '$s' server"            # the bridge's own start command
env -u HERDR_ENV -u HERDR_SESSION -u HERDR_SOCKET_PATH herdr --session $s workspace create --cwd /tmp --label demo --no-focus
bin/herdr-world --socket "$sock" --db /tmp/h3d-mytask/world.db --sessions '^h3d-mytask-' &
bin/herdr-world cmd --socket "$sock" floor.sleep "{\"session\":\"$s\"}"   # herdr session stop
bin/herdr-world cmd --socket "$sock" floor.wake  "{\"session\":\"$s\"}"   # systemd-run, resume checks
sqlite3 /tmp/h3d-mytask/world.db 'select cmd, ok, error, result from audit_log'
bin/herdr-world cmd --socket "$sock" floor.sleep "{\"session\":\"$s\"}" && herdr session delete $s
systemctl --user list-units --all 'herdr-s-*'                     # the unit is gone (--collect)
```

Real agents in such a session must be cheap: `claude --model claude-haiku-4-5-20251001 --effort low`, `codex -m
gpt-6-luna -c model_reasoning_effort=low`, one short turn. Never sleep or wake a session you did not create, and never
`systemctl stop` a `herdr-s-*` unit that `herdr session stop` can stop (it loses the agents' resume link).

| `--systemd-run` | `HERDR_WORLD_SYSTEMD_RUN` | `systemd-run` on `PATH`: starts woken sessions |
| `--sessions` | `HERDR_WORLD_SESSIONS` | all; a regexp limits which sessions are watched, and the only ones commands may wake, sleep or configure |

Install as a user service:

```sh
install -Dm755 bin/herdr-world ~/.local/bin/herdr-world
install -Dm644 deploy/herdr-world.service ~/.config/systemd/user/herdr-world.service
systemctl --user daemon-reload && systemctl --user enable --now herdr-world
journalctl --user -u herdr-world -f
```

### Integration test

`go test ./...` never touches herdr or systemd (fake socket server + recorded fixtures; `herdr.Control` gets a fake
`Runner` that plays herdr and systemd-run). `make integration` runs, with build tag `integration`, against the
installed herdr:

- `TestIntegrationThrowawaySession`: starts a headless server for a fresh session `h3d-it-<random>`, creates
  workspaces, reports a custom agent's states through `herdr pane report-agent` (no real coding agent), closes a
  workspace, stops the session, and asserts the bridge's events.
- `TestIntegrationSleepWake`: puts a throwaway floor with two workspaces to sleep with `floor.sleep`, wakes it with
  `floor.wake` through the real `systemd-run` path, and checks the workers keep their ids, desks and names, the
  transient unit `herdr-s-h3d-it-…` runs the server, and that server has none of the test's `CLAUDE*`/`HERDR_*`
  variables.

Both always name the `h3d-it-…` session explicitly, and the bridge under test watches only that session. They strip
`HERDR_*`/`CLAUDE*` pane variables from herdr's environment and in `t.Cleanup`, also on failure, stop the session with
`herdr session stop`, wait for the `herdr-s-h3d-it-…` unit to be collected (stopping it only as a last resort) and
delete the session. They never touch any other session, so they are safe to run from inside a herdr pane. If a run is
killed hard, check `herdr session list` for a leftover `h3d-it-*` session (`herdr session stop`/`delete` it) and
`systemctl --user list-units --all 'herdr-s-h3d-it-*'`.

## Helper (`h3d-helper`, Mac)

`h3d-helper` is what makes the game playable on the Mac:

- it owns `ssh -N -o ControlMaster=no -o ControlPath=none -o ExitOnForwardFailure=yes … -L <local.sock>:<bridge.sock>
  dev@devbox`, restarts it with exponential backoff (0.5 s doubling to 30 s, ±20 % jitter, back to 0.5 s after
  30 s up) and checks the bridge's `/healthz` through it every 5 s (3 failures in a row restart ssh). On exit it kills
  ssh's process group and removes the local socket;
- it serves the game on `http://127.0.0.1:7777` (loopback only; a secure context, so WebGPU works) from a built
  `game/dist`, or proxies a Vite dev server with `-dev-upstream`;
- it proxies `GET /ws` to the bridge, after checking Host, Origin and a per-start token (`docs/protocol.md`
  "Through h3d-helper");
- it opens a Chrome `--app` window on `http://127.0.0.1:7777/#token=…` with its own profile (`-no-open` skips that).
  The token changes at every start: after a restart, use the new window.

It needs non-interactive SSH from the Mac to the host (`BatchMode=yes`: a key in the agent/keychain, host key known).
State goes to the log (stderr): `tunnel connecting`, `tunnel up`, `bridge not answering through the tunnel`,
`tunnel down, restarting … retry_in=…`. `curl http://127.0.0.1:7777/healthz` shows the tunnel state.

| flag | env | default |
|---|---|---|
| `--host` | `H3D_HELPER_HOST` | `dev@devbox` |
| `--remote-socket` | `H3D_HELPER_REMOTE_SOCKET` | `/run/user/1000/herdr-world/bridge.sock` (the bridge's default) |
| `--local-socket` | `H3D_HELPER_LOCAL_SOCKET` | `~/Library/Caches/h3d-helper/bridge.sock` |
| `--listen` | `H3D_HELPER_LISTEN` | `127.0.0.1:7777`; anything but a loopback IP is refused |
| `--bundle` | `H3D_HELPER_BUNDLE` | `~/Library/Application Support/h3d-helper/dist` |
| `--dev-upstream` | `H3D_HELPER_DEV_UPSTREAM` | off; e.g. `http://127.0.0.1:5173` |
| `--no-open` | `H3D_HELPER_NO_OPEN` | `false` |
| `--chrome`, `--chrome-profile` | `H3D_HELPER_CHROME`, `H3D_HELPER_CHROME_PROFILE` | `Google Chrome`, `~/Library/Application Support/h3d-helper/chrome` |
| `--ssh` | `H3D_HELPER_SSH` | `ssh` on `PATH` |
| `--log-level`, `--log-format` | `H3D_HELPER_LOG_LEVEL`, `H3D_HELPER_LOG_FORMAT` | `info`, `text` (or `json`) |

Install as a launchd user agent, from the server (always `-o ControlMaster=no -o ControlPath=none`, see the rule below):

```sh
make helper-darwin game-build
mac=devmac; ssh="ssh -o ControlMaster=no -o ControlPath=none"
$ssh $mac 'mkdir -p ~/.local/bin ~/Library/LaunchAgents "Library/Application Support/h3d-helper" && rm -rf "Library/Application Support/h3d-helper/dist"'
scp -o ControlMaster=no -o ControlPath=none bin/darwin-arm64/h3d-helper $mac:.local/bin/h3d-helper
tar -C game -cf - dist | $ssh $mac 'tar -C "Library/Application Support/h3d-helper" -xf -'
$ssh $mac 'sed "s|@HOME@|$HOME|g" > Library/LaunchAgents/com.jeffreyvdb.h3d-helper.plist' < deploy/com.jeffreyvdb.h3d-helper.plist
$ssh $mac 'launchctl bootstrap gui/$(id -u) ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.jeffreyvdb.h3d-helper.plist'
```

Then on the Mac: `tail -f ~/Library/Logs/h3d-helper.log`. After an update, copy the binary/bundle again and
`launchctl kickstart -k gui/$(id -u)/com.jeffreyvdb.h3d-helper`. Uninstall:

```sh
launchctl bootout gui/$(id -u)/com.jeffreyvdb.h3d-helper
rm ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.jeffreyvdb.h3d-helper.plist ~/.local/bin/h3d-helper
rm -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/h3d-helper ~/Library/Caches/h3d-helper
```

Development: forward a Vite dev server (`make dev` on the server) to the Mac and point a helper at it (stop the agent
first, or give it another `-listen` port); HMR goes through the helper too:

```sh
ssh -o ControlMaster=no -o ControlPath=none -N -L 5173:127.0.0.1:<leased dev port> dev@devbox &
~/.local/bin/h3d-helper -dev-upstream http://127.0.0.1:5173
```

Agents test it without launchd and without a window: copy the binary and a `game/dist` to a temp dir such as
`~/h3d-tools/helper-<task>/`, run `./h3d-helper -no-open -remote-socket <private bridge socket> -bundle <dir>/dist
-local-socket <dir>/bridge.sock` (it logs the game URL with its token), drive headless Chrome from `~/h3d-tools`
(`playwright-core`), and stop it with SIGTERM when done. Mac port 7777 is the helper's; others use their own.

## Rule: never serve the game to the Mac over plain `http://<tailnet-host>`

WebGPU only exists in a [secure context](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Defenses/Secure_Contexts).
`http://devbox:<port>` is a remote, insecure origin, so Chrome **silently** falls back to WebGL2 — the game
still renders, but on the wrong backend, and any Metal/perf check is meaningless
(see [`docs/research/engine.verify.md`](docs/research/engine.verify.md)).

Always reach the server from the Mac through an SSH forward and open it on loopback:

```sh
ssh -o ControlMaster=no -o ControlPath=none -N -L <port>:127.0.0.1:<port> dev@devbox
# then open http://127.0.0.1:<port> (or http://localhost:<port>) on the Mac
```

`ControlMaster=no` matters: a tunnel that becomes the shared ControlMaster takes everyone's multiplexed SSH sessions
down with it when it is killed (`docs/architecture.md` §2, §7). Check the debug overlay says `backend: webgpu`.

## Game

`game/` is Vite + strict TypeScript + three.js r186 (`three/webgpu`, WebGL2 fallback). Layout:

- `src/net` — protocol v1 client (hello → welcome → snapshot | replay → events, reconnect with backoff from
  `since_seq` + `epoch`) and the endpoint: same-origin `/ws?token=…` (the helper opens `/#token=<token>`; the game
  keeps it in `sessionStorage` as `h3d.token` and strips it from the URL), `?ws=<url>` to point elsewhere.
- `src/world` — the world store (snapshot + events, fallbacks for an older bridge without `name`, `desk_index`,
  `harness`, `model`, `effort`, `status_since`, `floor.desks`), the deterministic office layout for a desk count,
  walking collision and ray picking. Pure logic, covered by vitest.
- `src/render` — city dollhouse, office floor, instanced rigid-part workers / desks, speech-bubble cards, frame policy.
  Cards and city badges are canvas atlases drawn as one instanced quad batch each (a cell per worker / floor, redrawn
  only when it changes). A DOM layer was benchmarked on the Mac and lost: moving DOM elements over the canvas cost
  2.6–4.3 ms of main thread per frame for 24 cards and ~8 ms for 30 city badges, against 0.5 ms for the atlas. The DOM
  keeps a static floor list for keyboards and screen readers.
- `src/ui` — the HUD (DOM over the canvas). `src/input` — first-person walking.
- `fixtures/` — recorded bridge streams (`herdr-world dump` format): `demo` (2 buildings, 3 floors, 40 workers),
  `perf-floor60`, `perf-city240`. `pnpm fixtures` regenerates them, `pnpm fixtures:check` flags stale files.
- `tools/` — fixture server, dev WebSocket → unix-socket proxy, throwaway-herdr helper, live and Mac perf drivers.

Run it:

```sh
make dev   # then open http://127.0.0.1:<port>/?ws=/fixture/demo   (Vite serves fixtures at /fixture/<name>)
pnpm -C game fixture-server   # standalone fixture server on a leased port: ?ws=ws://127.0.0.1:<port>/ws
# against a private bridge: node game/tools/ws-unix-proxy.ts --port <leased> --socket <bridge.sock>, then ?ws=ws://127.0.0.1:<leased>/ws
```

| query param | effect |
|---|---|
| `ws=<url or path>` | bridge endpoint (default same-origin `/ws`); fixtures take `?play=none\|all\|<ms>` |
| `backend=webgl2` | force WebGL2 |
| `floor=<session>`, `plan=1` | enter a floor on load, open its floor plan |
| `ts` | GPU timestamp queries (for `bench`) |
| `shadows=0`, `badges=0`, `battery=1` | no shadows; no city badges (perf comparisons); start in battery saver |

Controls: in the city, drag to orbit, scroll to zoom, click a building to focus it and a floor (or its badge) to go
inside. On a floor, click for mouse look (Pointer Lock), WASD / arrows to walk, Shift to run, Esc releases the mouse,
Tab toggles the floor plan (click the plan to walk there; it is also the fallback when pointer lock is refused),
Backspace or the City button goes back, B toggles battery saver (60 Hz moving / 30 Hz idle instead of 120 / 60).
Keyboard: in the city, Tab reaches the floor list (Enter goes inside). On a floor, Shift+Tab moves focus to the top
bar (City, Issues, PRs, battery saver); Tab / Shift+Tab then move between its buttons as usual and Enter presses one.
Tab toggles the plan only while nothing but the scene has focus; clicking the scene gives it focus back.

Tests:

```sh
make test lint                # vitest + tsc (protocol client, store, layout, collision, cards, frame policy, fixtures)
make shot                     # Playwright WebGL2: game/test-results/{shot,m2-city,m2-floor-plan,m2-desk-row}.png,
                              # scripted look-at path, floor entry, keyboard focus, live plan labels, events
                              # during the elevator ride, held keys across floors, small-window plan
pnpm -C game test:live        # opt-in: status latency against a throwaway herdr session (see below)
pnpm -C game perf:mac         # opt-in: Metal/WebGPU perf + screenshots on the Mac -> game/test-results/perf/
```

`test:live` builds `bin/herdr-world` from the worktree (or runs `H3D_LIVE_BRIDGE=<path>`, e.g. another branch's
bridge built elsewhere), starts `herdr --session h3d-m2game-<random> server` (with
`HERDR_*`/`CLAUDE*` stripped), a private bridge on `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/h3d-m2game/bridge.sock` watching only that session,
and the WebSocket → unix-socket proxy on a leased 127.0.0.1 port. The spec flips a custom agent's state with
`herdr pane report-agent` and asserts each change is on screen within 1 s. It accepts an M1 bridge (name falls back
to the label, desk to the lowest free local slot) and the M2 bridge (its own `name` and `desk_index`). The session is stopped and deleted
afterwards; after a hard kill, check `herdr session list` for a leftover `h3d-m2game-*` session.

`perf:mac` serves `game/dist` on a leased port P and opens `ssh -o ControlMaster=no -o ControlPath=none -N -R
127.0.0.1:P:127.0.0.1:P devmac`, so the Mac page is on its own loopback (a secure context: WebGPU).
It pipes `tools/mac-runner.mjs` into `/opt/homebrew/bin/node` in `~/h3d-tools` (playwright-core, headless Chrome at
3024×1890) and runs `window.__h3d.bench()` — the engine-bench method: serialized update + render + GPU wait,
pipelined throughput, GPU timestamps, and rAF frames that include DOM layout.

`window.__h3d` (tests, perf): `backend`, `frames`, `error`, `ready`, `view()`, `lookAt()` → `{kind, id, name?, label?}`
or null, `status(workerId)` → `{status, at}` as last rendered, `world()` (shown `name`/`desk` plus what the bridge
sent, `bridgeName`/`bridgeDesk`, null from an older bridge), `layout(session)`, `enterFloor(session, pose?)`,
`leaveFloor()`, `inject(event)` (applies a protocol event as if the bridge sent it), `setPose({x, z, yaw, pitch})`,
`pose()`, `plan(open)`, `focusBuilding(i)`, `cards()`, `badgePoint(session)`, `bench(opts)`.
