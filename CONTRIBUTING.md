## Layout

- `cmd/herdr-world` — server-side bridge daemon (Go).
- `cmd/h3d-helper` — Mac-side helper (Go, cross-compiled for `darwin/arm64`).
- `internal/` — shared Go packages. Bridge: `herdr` (the only herdr client, read-only), `watch` (session discovery and
  per-session watchers), `world` (floors/workers from snapshots and `session.json`, identity matching), `store` (SQLite),
  `server` (hub + WebSocket), `proto` (protocol v1 types and client), `app` (CLI).
- `deploy/` — `herdr-world.service` (systemd `--user`).
- `game/` — the game: Vite + strict TypeScript + three.js (`three/webgpu`), pnpm.

## Toolchain

Go 1.27 (see `go.mod`), Node 24.18 (`game/.nvmrc`), pnpm 11.7 (`packageManager` in `game/package.json`),
`portlease` for ports. CI uses the same pins.

## Build and test

```sh
make build test lint   # Go binaries -> bin/, game bundle -> game/dist/, go test + vitest, vet/gofmt/tsc
make integration       # bridge against a real herdr in a throwaway session (see below)
make helper-darwin     # bin/darwin-arm64/h3d-helper (CGO off)
make dev               # Vite dev server on a portlease-leased port, 127.0.0.1 only
make shot              # headless WebGL2 screenshot -> game/test-results/shot.png (non-blank check)
```

- `make shot` runs Playwright against the **cached** Chromium in `~/.cache/ms-playwright` (`@playwright/test` is pinned
  to the version that matches it). Browsers are never downloaded (`PLAYWRIGHT_SKIP_BROWSER_DOWNLOAD=1`). It forces the
  WebGL2 backend (`?backend=webgl2`) because the server has no GPU; rendering goes through ANGLE → Vulkan → mesa llvmpipe.
- The page exposes `window.__h3d` (`backend`, `frames`, `error`) for tests.
- Never hardcode ports. Use `portlease run` / `portlease reserve`, and bind `127.0.0.1` only. Other agents run in
  parallel worktrees on the same host.
- CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs go vet/gofmt/test, the darwin cross-build, tsc and vitest. No Playwright in CI.

## Bridge (`herdr-world`)

Protocol: [`docs/protocol.md`](docs/protocol.md). The bridge only **reads** herdr: every herdr call goes through
`internal/herdr`, whose socket methods are allowlisted to `ping`, `session.snapshot` and `events.subscribe` (plus
`herdr session list --json`). `TestReadOnlyAllowlist` is the tripwire; widening it needs review. Its own state is the
SQLite database.

Run a private instance next to (or instead of) the real one; `dump` and `cmd` take the same `--socket`:

```sh
make go-build
sock=$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/h3d-dev/bridge.sock   # unix socket paths must stay under ~107 bytes
bin/herdr-world --socket "$sock" --db /tmp/h3d-dev/world.db --log-level debug
bin/herdr-world dump --socket "$sock"            # snapshot, then events as JSON lines until Ctrl-C
bin/herdr-world dump --socket "$sock" --once | jq '.world.floors'
bin/herdr-world cmd --socket "$sock" building.create '{"name":"Work"}'
bin/herdr-world cmd --socket "$sock" floor.assign '{"session":"herdr-3d","building":"b_…"}'
```

| flag | env | default |
|---|---|---|
| `--socket` | `HERDR_WORLD_SOCKET` | `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/herdr-world/bridge.sock` |
| `--db` (serve) | `HERDR_WORLD_DB` | `$XDG_STATE_HOME/herdr-world/world.db`, else `~/.local/state/herdr-world/world.db` |
| `--herdr` | `HERDR_WORLD_HERDR` | `herdr` on `PATH` |
| `--sessions` | `HERDR_WORLD_SESSIONS` | all; a regexp limits which sessions are watched |
| `--poll`, `--resnapshot` | `HERDR_WORLD_POLL`, `HERDR_WORLD_RESNAPSHOT` | `2s`, `30s` |
| `--log-level`, `--log-format` | `HERDR_WORLD_LOG_LEVEL`, `HERDR_WORLD_LOG_FORMAT` | `info`, `text` (or `json`) |

Install as a user service:

```sh
install -Dm755 bin/herdr-world ~/.local/bin/herdr-world
install -Dm644 deploy/herdr-world.service ~/.config/systemd/user/herdr-world.service
systemctl --user daemon-reload && systemctl --user enable --now herdr-world
journalctl --user -u herdr-world -f
```

### Integration test

`go test ./...` never touches herdr (fake socket server + recorded fixtures). `make integration` runs
`TestIntegrationThrowawaySession` (build tag `integration`) against the installed herdr: it starts a headless server for
a fresh session `h3d-it-<random>`, creates workspaces, reports a custom agent's states through `herdr pane report-agent`
(no real coding agent), closes a workspace, stops the session, and asserts the bridge's events. It always passes
`--session h3d-it-…` explicitly, strips `HERDR_*`/`CLAUDE*` pane variables from herdr's environment, and stops and deletes
the session in `t.Cleanup`, also on failure. It never touches any other session, so it is safe to run from inside a
herdr pane. If a run is killed hard, check `herdr session list` for a leftover `h3d-it-*` session and
`herdr session stop`/`delete` it.

## Rule: never serve the game to the Mac over plain `http://<tailnet-host>`

WebGPU only exists in a [secure context](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Defenses/Secure_Contexts).
`http://devbox:<port>` is a remote, insecure origin, so Chrome **silently** falls back to WebGL2 — the game
still renders, but on the wrong backend, and any Metal/perf check is meaningless
(see [`docs/research/engine.verify.md`](docs/research/engine.verify.md)).

Always reach the server from the Mac through an SSH forward and open it on loopback:

```sh
ssh -o ControlMaster=no -o ControlPath=none -N -L <port>:127.0.0.1:<port> dev@devbox
# then open http://127.0.0.1:<port> (or http://localhost:<port>) on the Mac
```

`ControlMaster=no` matters: a tunnel that becomes the shared ControlMaster takes everyone's multiplexed SSH sessions
down with it when it is killed (`docs/architecture.md` §2, §7). Check the debug overlay says `backend: webgpu`.

## Game

`game/` is Vite + strict TypeScript + three.js r186 (`three/webgpu`, WebGL2 fallback). Layout:

- `src/net` — protocol v1 client (hello → welcome → snapshot | replay → events, reconnect with backoff from
  `since_seq` + `epoch`) and the endpoint: same-origin `/ws?token=…` (the helper opens `/#token=<token>`; the game
  keeps it in `sessionStorage` as `h3d.token` and strips it from the URL), `?ws=<url>` to point elsewhere.
- `src/world` — the world store (snapshot + events, fallbacks for an older bridge without `name`, `desk_index`,
  `harness`, `model`, `effort`, `status_since`, `floor.desks`), the deterministic office layout for a desk count,
  walking collision and ray picking. Pure logic, covered by vitest.
- `src/render` — city dollhouse, office floor, instanced rigid-part workers / desks, speech-bubble cards, frame policy.
  Cards and city badges are canvas atlases drawn as one instanced quad batch each (a cell per worker / floor, redrawn
  only when it changes). A DOM layer was benchmarked on the Mac and lost: moving DOM elements over the canvas cost
  2.6–4.3 ms of main thread per frame for 24 cards and ~8 ms for 30 city badges, against 0.5 ms for the atlas. The DOM
  keeps a static floor list for keyboards and screen readers.
- `src/ui` — the HUD (DOM over the canvas). `src/input` — first-person walking.
- `fixtures/` — recorded bridge streams (`herdr-world dump` format): `demo` (2 buildings, 3 floors, 40 workers),
  `perf-floor60`, `perf-city240`. `pnpm fixtures` regenerates them, `pnpm fixtures:check` flags stale files.
- `tools/` — fixture server, dev WebSocket → unix-socket proxy, throwaway-herdr helper, live and Mac perf drivers.

Run it:

```sh
make dev   # then open http://127.0.0.1:<port>/?ws=/fixture/demo   (Vite serves fixtures at /fixture/<name>)
pnpm -C game fixture-server   # standalone fixture server on a leased port: ?ws=ws://127.0.0.1:<port>/ws
# against a private bridge: node game/tools/ws-unix-proxy.ts --port <leased> --socket <bridge.sock>, then ?ws=ws://127.0.0.1:<leased>/ws
```

| query param | effect |
|---|---|
| `ws=<url or path>` | bridge endpoint (default same-origin `/ws`); fixtures take `?play=none\|all\|<ms>` |
| `backend=webgl2` | force WebGL2 |
| `floor=<session>`, `plan=1` | enter a floor on load, open its floor plan |
| `ts` | GPU timestamp queries (for `bench`) |
| `shadows=0`, `badges=0`, `battery=1` | no shadows; no city badges (perf comparisons); start in battery saver |

Controls: in the city, drag to orbit, scroll to zoom, click a building to focus it and a floor (or its badge) to go
inside. On a floor, click for mouse look (Pointer Lock), WASD / arrows to walk, Shift to run, Esc releases the mouse,
Tab toggles the floor plan (click the plan to walk there; it is also the fallback when pointer lock is refused),
Backspace or the City button goes back, B toggles battery saver (60 Hz moving / 30 Hz idle instead of 120 / 60).
Keyboard: in the city, Tab reaches the floor list (Enter goes inside). On a floor, Shift+Tab moves focus to the top
bar (City, Issues, PRs, battery saver); Tab / Shift+Tab then move between its buttons as usual and Enter presses one.
Tab toggles the plan only while nothing but the scene has focus; clicking the scene gives it focus back.

Tests:

```sh
make test lint                # vitest + tsc (protocol client, store, layout, collision, cards, frame policy, fixtures)
make shot                     # Playwright WebGL2: game/test-results/{shot,m2-city,m2-floor-plan,m2-desk-row}.png,
                              # scripted look-at path, floor entry, keyboard focus, live plan labels, events
                              # during the elevator ride, held keys across floors, small-window plan
pnpm -C game test:live        # opt-in: status latency against a throwaway herdr session (see below)
pnpm -C game perf:mac         # opt-in: Metal/WebGPU perf + screenshots on the Mac -> game/test-results/perf/
```

`test:live` builds `bin/herdr-world` from the worktree (or runs `H3D_LIVE_BRIDGE=<path>`, e.g. another branch's
bridge built elsewhere), starts `herdr --session h3d-m2game-<random> server` (with
`HERDR_*`/`CLAUDE*` stripped), a private bridge on `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/h3d-m2game/bridge.sock` watching only that session,
and the WebSocket → unix-socket proxy on a leased 127.0.0.1 port. The spec flips a custom agent's state with
`herdr pane report-agent` and asserts each change is on screen within 1 s. It accepts an M1 bridge (name falls back
to the label, desk to the lowest free local slot) and the M2 bridge (its own `name` and `desk_index`). The session is stopped and deleted
afterwards; after a hard kill, check `herdr session list` for a leftover `h3d-m2game-*` session.

`perf:mac` serves `game/dist` on a leased port P and opens `ssh -o ControlMaster=no -o ControlPath=none -N -R
127.0.0.1:P:127.0.0.1:P devmac`, so the Mac page is on its own loopback (a secure context: WebGPU).
It pipes `tools/mac-runner.mjs` into `/opt/homebrew/bin/node` in `~/h3d-tools` (playwright-core, headless Chrome at
3024×1890) and runs `window.__h3d.bench()` — the engine-bench method: serialized update + render + GPU wait,
pipelined throughput, GPU timestamps, and rAF frames that include DOM layout.

`window.__h3d` (tests, perf): `backend`, `frames`, `error`, `ready`, `view()`, `lookAt()` → `{kind, id, name?, label?}`
or null, `status(workerId)` → `{status, at}` as last rendered, `world()` (shown `name`/`desk` plus what the bridge
sent, `bridgeName`/`bridgeDesk`, null from an older bridge), `layout(session)`, `enterFloor(session, pose?)`,
`leaveFloor()`, `inject(event)` (applies a protocol event as if the bridge sent it), `setPose({x, z, yaw, pitch})`,
`pose()`, `plan(open)`, `focusBuilding(i)`, `cards()`, `badgePoint(session)`, `bench(opts)`.
